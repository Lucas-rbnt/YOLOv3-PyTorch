# YOLOv3 From Scratch
Here you can find an implementation of YOLOv3 according to the five-parts tutorial written
by [
AYOOSH KATHURIA](https://blog.paperspace.com/author/ayoosh/).
Accompanying code for Paperspace tutorial series ["How to Implement YOLO v3 Object Detector from Scratch"](https://blog.paperspace.com/how-to-implement-a-yolo-object-detector-in-pytorch/)

I just add some extra features such as pre-commit yaml file in order to have a nice code and little other things.
I work on it as a regular project with some little extra.

Enjoy and don't forget to check the initial tutorial, it is well-explained and well described.
I also recommand to read about YOLO on arXiv.
